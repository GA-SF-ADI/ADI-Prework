Our immersive course teaches students about Android mobile development. This field is constantly evolving, and it would be impossible to cover every tool in one course.

Instead, General Assembly provides a core set of objectives for this course, along with guidelines for how to ensure students reach these objectives. As an instructor, you have the opportunity and responsibility to adapt these recommendations to your local context and modify/expand on any of these tools as you see fit.

## Required Tools for Students

#### Laptop

A Mac laptop is (*preferred*), especially if you don't have a background in computing.

Windows machines and Linux machines are acceptable but it is **expected** that you will be able to debug any and
all machine related issues on your own. Generally, students don't have too much trouble running Windows.

- You should have a **minimum of 6gb of ram**, however we strongly encourage a minimum of 8gb of ram or more.
- Android Studio and the gradle build system are resource intensive. An **i-5** or comparable CPU is recommended as the minimum requirement.
- *Optional* A solid state hard drive in your machine, it will save you a lot of time during builds.
- Upgrade laptop OS to the latest version, as needed.

#### Software 

Students are required to install the following software
- [Java Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- [IntelliJ IDE for Java practice](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
- [Genymotion Emulator](https://www.genymotion.com/)

## Optional Tools

#### Android Device

*Optional* You can bring your own Android device if you choose. Nexus 5 is a great and cheap option for development if bought used/refurbished. 

GA will provide a mix of Nexus 7/9 Tablets for the class to use, however the quanitity is limited.
- Download and install the latest version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

#### Text Editors

Simple and yet powerful text editors that recognize Java code
- [Atom](https://atom.io)
- [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com)


## Technology Policy

General Assembly introduces students to concepts using the environment, tools, and ethics of the open-source community. We try to only use languages and tools that are open-source and free for commercial use.

#### Laptop Policy

We strongly suggest that students use a Mac ( instructional team uses Macs ) that meets the minimum requirements listed above. If a student is comfortable with computing environments, they are free to use Windows/Linux but instructor support for machine issues will be limited. 

Screen size of *at least 13-inches* is required. Having an 11-inch (or smaller) screen has been shown to adversely affect student performance.

#### Operating Systems Policy

**Mac:** Student laptops should be using OS X 10.8.5 or higher, up to 10.11.4 (El Capitan). Students should update their OS before starting the course.

Note: *This rules out the use of some older MacBooks*
