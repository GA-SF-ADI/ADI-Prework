This document outlines the Technology Policy the Android Development Immersive at General Assembly.

#### Laptop Policy

A laptop is **required** for this course. A Mac laptop is *preferred*, especially if you don't have a background in computing.

Windows machines and Linux machines are acceptable but it is **expected** that you will be able to debug any and all machine related issues on your own. *Instructor support for machine issues will be limited*. 

Generally, students don't have too much trouble running Windows. [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) seems to perform better then Windows.

###### Minimum Computer Specs
- *6gb of ram*, however we strongly encourage 8gb of ram or more.
- *4th generation i-5* CPU or better. The newer and beefier the CPU is, the better your experience will be.
- *13-inch* screen or above. Having an 11-inch (or smaller) screen has been shown to adversely affect student performance.
- *Latest* Operating System version. 

###### Optional Computer Specs
- A solid state drive in your machine, it will save you a lot of time during builds.

#### Android Device Policy

This is an Android Application Development course, we will be building and testing Applications on emulators and real devices.

- General Assembly will provide a mix of Nexus 7 and Nexus 9 Tablets for the class to use. However, the quanitity is limited.
- You can bring your own Android device if you choose. The Nexus 5 is a great and cheap option for development, especially if bought used/refurbished. 

#### Software Policy

General Assembly introduces students to concepts using the environment, tools, and ethics of the open-source community. We try to only use languages and tools that are open-source and free for commercial use.
