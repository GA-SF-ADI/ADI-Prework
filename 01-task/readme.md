[Welcome to the Android Development Immersive at General Assembly!](https://github.com/GA-SF-ADI/Pre-class-work)

We're really excited to have join our General Assembly community! In order to ensure your success in the course, weâ€™ve created the following pre-course onboarding materials. Depending on your level of prior knowledge, these tutorials, modules, and projects may take you between 40-60 hours to complete.

Please complete **all** items **before** your first day of class, so that both you and your computer will be prepared to hit the ground running. If you have questions in the meantime (or just want to say hi!), feel free to reach out to your instructional team!

Once you've finished everything on this list, you will be taking a [Quiz]() to make sure you've learned the material. There is also a small [Java project]() for you to complete. Failure to submit either of these by first day of class will result in you being dismissed from the course.

Sincerely,

GA + your Android Immersive Team
