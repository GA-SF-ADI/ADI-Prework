 ## Introduction

There is one final coding challenge we want you to complete before class begins. 

We are going to give you an array of Strings called hiddenMessage. Hidden inside is a hidden message (surprise!) that you need to decode. 

## The Challenge

Here is the array

`         String[] hiddenMessage = {"hello", "bigly", "co#", "wel", "bat", "come", "tog", "cat", "inan", "en", "er", "meta", "alas", "paw", "i", "docs", "super", "mvp", "sem", "couch", "blys", "and", "meow", "moo", "ro", "id", "msjd", "imm", "cawcaw", "awe", "feir", "refs", "ewce", "ers", "jaz", "ive", "pro", "ram", "mcd", "gr", "am", "h"}; `

The message is hidden in the array at the indexes that are divisble by three OR five but not both! The challenge is for you to loop through the array and print out each String at the correct indicies in order to decode our message!

HINT: Remember the modulo (%) function and how it works in java!
